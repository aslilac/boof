</h1>

An implementation of Brainfuck in Rust, with an extra couple quality-of-life instructions.
Not "oh man, this is so easy now!" quality of life, more like "wow, this is the bare
minimum amount of instrospection I expect a system to provide me!"

Boof also has a cute lil mascot named August. He's a very a very good boy. :)
